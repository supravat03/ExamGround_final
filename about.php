               ExaMania is a web-based application for technical evaluation. During this
pandemic it has become difficult for students to be physically present to give
exams and for the institute as well to conduct exams while following all
pandemic-rules. There comes the need to change the way most of the exams are
conducted. It fulfills the requirement of institute to conduct exams online. This
next step turns out to be more efficient for student as well as professor. Student
and Professor are no longer required to be physically present for the smooth
conduction of exams and it becomes easier for Professor's to efficiently evaluate
the students thoroughly through a fully automated system that not only saves lot
of time, efforts but also gives fast results. There is no chance of leakage of
question paper.
